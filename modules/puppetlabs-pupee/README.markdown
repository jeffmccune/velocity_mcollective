# Puppet Enterprise Packages #

This module manages the Puppet Enterprise packages without installing Puppet
Enterprise itself.

It is primarily intended to easily install the Ruby runtime used with Puppet
Enterprise for development and testing.

You should have the PE RPM's in an available yum repository.  If you do not,
one is available at:
